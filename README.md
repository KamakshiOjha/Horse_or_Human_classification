# Horse or Human Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

In this project, I've developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to perform image classification. CNNs are a powerful tool for computer vision tasks, making them ideal for scenarios like image classification.

Model Architecture : 

I've created a deep learning model using the Sequential API from TensorFlow and Keras.
The model consists of multiple layers, including Convolutional Layers for feature extraction and Dense (fully connected) Layers for classification.
